--int ? > standby ? ip ????
	standby ? authentication md5 pass
	standby ? priority
	standby ? preempt
	standby ? timer hellosec holdsec
exept priority all other commands need to be enter exactly same on every HSRP gateway
we can use vlan as int to have instance of HSRP for every vlan
active GW must be STP rootbridge

to control decrement of active & stand by automaticaly
--track ? int ? ip routing reachability
--int? > standby ? track ? decrement xvalue
if preempt was defined, after tracks goes down priority decrease by xvalue and will increase after track comes up
