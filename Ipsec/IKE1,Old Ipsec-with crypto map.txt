in this mode we need to maintaine gre tunnel first
1)phase 1 bidirectional tunnel
conf t
	crypto isakamp policy ?>5
		authenti ?
		hash ?
		encryp ?
		group	?>14
conf t
	crypto iskamp key -pass- address ???=who can use this pass to negotiate ipsec as a new peer 
						if it sets to 0.0.0.0 means all ip address must use this pass
2)phase 2 transform set ipsec
conf t
	crypto ipsec transform-set ?? ESP/AH
	example: crypto ipsec transform-set T-set esp-aes 192 esp-sha256-hmac   those who has hm,ac at the end are authentication types
	-----and then we should choose ipsec operation mode-----
		>> mode transport
3)creat ACL
conf t
	ip access-list ext ???  in old ipsec config we should make a acl that determined which traffics must encryptrd throw ipsec 
		permit ip any any  = this means any traffic ,ust be encapsulated with ipsec

4)crypto map setup
conf t
	crypto map name number value
	example = crypto map C-map 10 ipsec-isakmp
		match addr -ACL in step 3-
		set peer tunnel ip address = we can use this as much as we need to set more than 1 peer
		set transform-set -t-set in step 2-

5) set crypto map under tunnel or int
conf t
	int tunnel 1
		crypto map -c-map name in step 4-

there is one other possibilty that we need to assign c-map to wan interface directly
in this way changes are follow:
peers should enterd as wan ip address instead of tunnel
acl must change that only peers traffic get encapsulated with ipsec not all incoming traffic on wan int
best way to config acl is > permit Gre any any > means that encapsulate only gre packets to ipsec
in this way gre header get into esp encapsulation and wiresharks shows no gre header 

assigning profiles to tunnel must be perform on each tunnel peers DMVPN or GR 

after all both of this methods are not recommended
