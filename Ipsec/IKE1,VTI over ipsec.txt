in this mode there is no need to maintaine gre tunnel first
1)phase 1 bidirectional tunnel
conf t
	crypto isakamp policy ?>5
		authenti ?
		hash ?
		encryp ?
		group	?>14
conf t
	crypto iskamp key -pass- address ???=who can use this pass to negotiate ipsec as a new peer 
						if it sets to 0.0.0.0 means all ip address must use this pass
2)phase 2 transform set ipsec
conf t
	crypto ipsec transform-set ?? ESP/AH
	example: crypto ipsec transform-set T-set esp-aes 192 esp-sha256-hmac   those who has hm,ac at the end are authentication types
	-----and then we should choose ipsec operation mode-----
		>> mode tunnel<<

3)ipsec profile
	conf t
		crypto ipsec profile ?name
			set transform-set -t-set name in step 2-
4)assign profile to tunnel
conf t
	int tuunel 1
		tunnel mode ipsec ipv4

assigning profiles to tunnel must be perform on each tunnel peers DMVPN or GR
