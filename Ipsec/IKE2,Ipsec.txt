IKE2 is more secure & armed with anti DOS attack and asymetric authentication(psk peer should negotiate with certificate peer).

1)Keyring
conf t
	crypto ikev2 keyring ?name
		peer ?name	
			address ?ip ?mask
				pre-shared-key ?pass
2)ikev2 profile
conf t
	crypto ikev2 profile ?name
		match fvrf ?name = only if we have fvrf + DMVPN
		match identity remote addr ?ip = 0.0.0.0 means this profile will affect all vpn hosts
		auth remote pre-share
		auth local pre-share
		keyring local ?name in step 1

Step 1+2 are phase 1

3)ipsec transform-set 
conf t
	crypto ipsec transform-set esp-aes 192 esp-sha-256-hmac
		mode transport

4)ipsec profile
conf t
	crypto ipsec profile ?name
		set transform-set ?t-set name step 3
		set ikev2 profile ?p-name in step 2
5)Assign to tunnel
conf t
	int tunnel 1
		tunnel protection ipsec profile ?p-name step 4
6)DOS
conf t
	crypto ikev2 limit max-sa ? recommended to set double value of ongoing sa in order to renegotiate
	crypto ikev2 limit cookie-challenge ?4 = perform security for half-open sessions
	crypto ikev2 limit max-in-negotiation-sa = maximum negotiation of sa at on time
	

assigning profiles to tunnel must be perform on each tunnel peers DMVPN or GR
