DMVP phase 1HQ:  NHS(nhrp server or hub) NHC(nhrp clients or spokes)
 HUB side--int tunnel ?
		ip address ip mask 
		ip mtu 1400
		ip nhrp authentication -pass-
		ip nhrp network-id X (x value must be same on all branches)
		ip nhrp map multicast dynamic
		tunnel source ?
		tunnel mode gre multipoint
		ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
DMVPN phase 1 branhcs:
 Spoke side --int tunnel?
		ip nhrp nhs -ip- (nhrp server ip or HUB tunnel ip)
		ip nhrp map -(HUB tunnel addr)- -(HUB Wan addr or NBMA addr)
		ip nhrp authentication pass
		ip nhrp network-id ?
		ip nhrp map multicast -(HUB wan addr)
		tunnel source (spoke wan addr)
		tunnel destination ( HuB wan addr)
we can use 
ip nhrp nhs (hub tunnel addr) nbma (HUB wan addr) multicast 
instead of 3 nhrp command that commented earlier

routes on spokes determined HUB tunnle as Next hop
so all spokes routes known HUB as next hop 
even if we determine spoke to spoke routes cause of phase 1 topology our packet travel through HUB 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMVPN Phase 2 
		HUB: Same as phase 1
		Spokes: same as phase 1 but:
			--no tunnel destination
			--tunnle mode gre multipoint
in other word in phase 2 we got bot side of tunnle as MGRE or multipont GRE thus there is no need to 
specifing tunnel destination

in phase 2 resolution request travel through HUB but resolution reply transfer directly from spoke to spoke
so we can create route more specific
in phase 2 DMVPN avoide to specify interface as nexthop
		 connection from spokes to hub are statics & permanent but spokes to spoke are Dynamic 
		 on-demand and managed with nhrp 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMVPN Phase 3
		Same as Phase 2 with 2 excese commands
		HUB: --ip nhrp redirect
		Spokes: --ip nhrp shortcut

Route on spokes: --ip route ?ip? ?mask? ? Wan ip HUB?
 % = nexthop override with nhrp
in phase 2 we must create a route for every spokes on every spokes & if we got many spokes this comes defficult to handle , so we use PH3 and only create a route to hub n every spoke in this way nhrp on hub will notice that we set redirect command thus it replaces our next hop with better and direct one 

Tips:
HUB side must have avery spokes route 
If our Spokes using a default route or default gateway for his own internet we cant set default route to HUB side ( this matter can be solved with Front-VRF or FVRF )
